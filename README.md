# Widget Grid Layout Project

## Overview

This project is a responsive widget grid layout designed to replicate a Figma design as closely as possible. I followed the dimensions provided in the Figma file, opting for more fixed values rather than making the layout overly dynamic to preserve design accuracy. While the design was somewhat vague and in another language, I believe the result is quite close to the intended outcome.

### Design Adjustments

Due to some ambiguity in the design, I made a few adjustments myself to enhance visual coherence and overall aesthetics. My goal was to deliver a layout that not only closely follows the Figma mockup but is also visually appealing and functional.

## Tech Stack

- **SCSS (Sass)** - I modularized the CSS across components using SCSS partials, which helped maintain structure and scalability.
- **React** - Built the layout components in React.

## Key Decisions
- **Fixed Dimensions**: While the project could have been more dynamic, I opted to follow the static dimensions mentioned in the Figma file to replicate the design precisely.
- **Widget Component Design**: I chose not to create each widget as an individual component, which would be the correct approach in a real application. For simplicity, I kept all widgets within the main grid component.

## Usage

To compile SCSS into CSS, run the following command:

```bash
sass .:.
```
